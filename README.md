# Dashboard for ASP.NET Core - How to Use MailKit to Send a Dashboard as a Document in PDF

This example demonstrates how to email an exported Dashboard document (PDF in this example) with the [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) cross-platform mail client library.

Handle the [ViewerApiExtension.onDashboardTitleToolbarUpdated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtensionOptions#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextensionoptions_ondashboardtitletoolbarupdated) event to add a custom **Email** button to the [Dashboard Title](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117383/web-dashboard/ui-elements-and-customization/ui-elements/dashboard-title). Once a user clicks the button, an **$.ajax** POST request is sent to the server to pass the dashboard's ID and [State](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/119997/web-dashboard/aspnet-core-dashboard-control/manage-dashboard-state) from the client.

On the server side, the **IndexModel.OnPostEmail** method is called to accept the callback and its parameters. The [DashboardExporter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardExporter) class instance exports a corresponding  dashboard to a PDF document and sends it as an attachment along with the **MimeMessage** object from the [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) library.

> **Note**:
>  The test [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/) SMTP server is used in this example. You can replace the authentication parameters passed to the **SmtpClient.Connect** and **SmtpClient.Authenticate** methods with parameters that correspond to your email server.
